In this study, molecular-based methods were used to identified a collection of xx single-spore *Fusarium* isolates, which were collected from naturally FHB-infected spikes of different small grain hosts (wheat, spelt, barley, and rye) during the Summer 2018 and 2019 across Pennsylvania. A specific primer (Fg16) was used to identified members of the *Fusarium graminearum* species complex (FGSC), while EF-1Î± sequences were obtained for the non-FGSC isolates. The trichothecene (toxin) types for those isolates, as well as for an additional set of 77 *F. graminearum* isolates from overwintering crop residues during the Winter 2012, were determined with a multiplex PCR assay that amplified portions of the *TRI3* and *TRI12* genes. Additionally, a subsample of 31 *F. graminearum* isolates, 16 of 3ADON and 15 of the 15ADON type, were assessed for their reproductive fitness and sensitivity to triazole-based fungicides.
